To get started, log in to your Gmail or Google Workspace account.
From your account dashboard, go to App passwords in your security settings and click the Select app dropdown.
Next, select the Other (Custom name) option from the dropdown menu.
Then, enter Easy WP SMTP in the field provided and click the blue GENERATE button.
